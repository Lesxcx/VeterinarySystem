Write an application that will imitate the veterinary system. On entry, the application should show a menu where you can add a patient or check patients.

Patient data should be saved in a file in .json format. Files should be saved in a directory named by the owner.
JSON file structure:
{
name: Patient's name,
owner: Owner's name,
breed: Breed,
Age: Age,
issue: The reason why the patient came to us
date: Date of the visit
}

In this app I would like to be able to filter by owner, breed, day.

The application should be written according to the basic principles of object-oriented programming. Tests written with JUnit.
